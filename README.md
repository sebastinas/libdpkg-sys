# Bindings for libdpkg

This crate provides bindings to interact with `libdpkg`. Note that only a part of the public API is available driven by my personal needs. I am happy to merge pull requests that expose functions of `libdpkg`'s public API.

This crate is only useful on systems where the development files for `libdpkg` are available. That is, it requires `libdpkg-dev` to be installed.
